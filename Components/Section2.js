            Welcome to my little digital garden in this vast world, where I
            share my learnings.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-pallet1-blueGrotto mb-3">
            I am currently a 4th year undergrad student of Computer Science and
            Engineering. I am a developer and a technical writer. I love to code
            and also mutually solve problems within peers. I also like teaching
            code to my juniors in Hackiton(The official coding club of my
            college ðŸ˜…).
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-pallet1-blueGrotto mb-3">
            Though I have worked with various technologies, my inclination and
            strengths lies towards frontend side of things. I have worked with
            Javascript, Typescript, React, Redux, Nextjs, Jest. I have also
            worked with various backend technologies like Nodejs, Expressjs,
            MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-pallet1-blueGrotto mb-3">
            I started Web development in the covid lockdown, back in
            April 2020 and most of it at <span className="text-pallet1-navyBlue font-medium underline">
              <a href="https://neog.camp/" target="_blank">neoG Camp</a>
            </span>, a Cohort Based Course taught by <span className="text-pallet1-navyBlue font-medium underline">
                <a href="https://tanaypratap.com/" target="_blank">Tanay Pratap</a>.
            </span> The team based learning and getting inspiration from peer groups really boosted my confidence and skillset in web development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-pallet1-blueGrotto mb-3">
                Apart From web development I also like solving DSA problems, Before web development I used to do Competitive Programming, but couldn't get much success ðŸ˜¥ there, So shifted towards development.
